      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>- Strength Pit Otara was born out of the passion to facilitate a safe place, tailored for Maori and Pasifika to be themselves, and grow their natural strength.</p>
      <p><p>
      <p>- Coach Afaese Paea, born and bred in Otara, always had a interest in strength sports, powerlifting, martial arts and Rugby.</p>
      <p>- While browsing around the big boys toys one year he stumbled across a Strongman event at the Easter Show back in 2005 - 2006 and searched how to get involved in that sport.And the rest is history, his first Novice competition he won without any training and then decided to pursue the NZ Strongman Arena.</p>
      <p>- Due to the events being few and far between it was difficult to train without the apparatusâ€™s so we decided to offer strength training to a local Box Empire Training Box based in Otara back in 2014 and the word got around and some 10 poly boys started showing up after the Box had closed.</p>
      <p>- Thanks to a really good mate also born and bred in Otara Lama Saga loaned us his space until we out grew it.</p>
      <p>- We set up officially in June 2015, and operate online coaching, strength and conditioning workshops all over the country and have Athletes competing in Strongman both in NZ and Australia.</p>
